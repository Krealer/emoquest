# EmoQuest

EmoQuest is a lightweight, text-based experience exploring emotional and psychological themes. It works entirely in the browser with no external assets and is suitable for GitHub Pages hosting.

Stories are written as JSON files inside the `stories/` folder. Each choice a player makes is tracked locally to provide gentle progress feedback.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to add your own scenarios.
