# Project Overview

EmoQuest is a browser-based story engine focused on gentle emotional exploration. All logic runs on the client which keeps deployment simple while still allowing reflective experiences.

## Structure
- **HTML/CSS/JS** in the project root provide the interface and core logic.
- **stories/** contains JSON files that define each scenario.
- **localStorage** is used to remember progress, choices and journaling preferences.

## Purpose
The goal is to encourage short moments of introspection. Players navigate short scenes that highlight different feelings and perspectives.

## Philosophy
EmoQuest avoids judging choices as right or wrong. Instead it surfaces insights and prompts reflections so players can notice their own patterns.
