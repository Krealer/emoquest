# Emotional Design

Stories should invite curiosity and empathy. Keep language gentle and avoid declaring choices as right or wrong.

- Speak in second person so players feel personally addressed.
- Offer multiple perspectives instead of binary good/bad paths.
- Encourage reflection through open questions.
- When in doubt, keep prompts short and supportive.

The tone guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` apply to all story contributions.
